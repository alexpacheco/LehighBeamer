# Lehigh Beamer Theme

Beamer Theme that I created for presentations using the color schemes of Lehigh University. The theme is designed to look similar to Lehigh's Powerpoint Template

## Disclaimer

This is not an official template for Lehigh University nor has it been endorsed by anyone at Lehigh. I created the theme for the LTS seminar presentations and a few students asked for a template. Use and modify for your own use.
